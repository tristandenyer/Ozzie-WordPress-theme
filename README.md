<h1>Ozzie: a free, responsive WordPress theme</h1>
<img src="http://ozzie.tristandenyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ozzie-devices.jpg" alt="Ozzie WordPress theme on mobile devices" style="width: 100%; height: auto; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<p>Ozzie is a free WordPress theme built using the Roots WordPress starter theme, and designed for users that like to showcase their featured images.</p>
<p>All future development will be maintained here, in GitHub.</p>
<h2>Demo</h2>
<p>The current demo for this theme can be found here: <a href="http://ozzie.tristandenyer.com/" title="Demo: Ozzie WordPress theme" target="_blank">http://ozzie.tristandenyer.com/</a></p>
<h2>Is there support?</h2>
<p>Since Ozzie is a free WordPress theme, there is no ‘premium’ support to the level you would find on marketplaces like ThemeForest or WooThemes.</p>
<p>If there are bugs in the theme, please let me know by submitting an issue here, and I’ll look into fixing them. But, know that it may take a day, or 30, to get fixed. <strong>Updates will be announced on Twitter.</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/tristandenyer" target="_blank">Follow me</a>.</p>
<h2>Changelog</h2>
<h3>0.1.1:</h3>
<ul><li>Removed superfluous CSS file.</li>
<li>Added line to Google Analytics script to support display advertising (though native, I still recommend you use a Google Analytics plugin.)</li></ul>
