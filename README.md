<img src="http://ozzie.tristandenyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ozzie-devices.jpg" alt="Ozzie WordPress theme on mobile devices" style="width: 100%; height: auto; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<p>Ozzie is a free WordPress theme built using the Roots WordPress starter theme, and designed for users that like to showcase their featured images.</p>
<p>All future development will be maintained here, in GitHub.</p>
<h2>Demo</h2>
<p>The current demo for this theme can be found here: <a href="http://ozzie.tristandenyer.com/" title="Demo: Ozzie WordPress theme" target="_blank">http://ozzie.tristandenyer.com/</a></p>
<h2>Is there support?</h2>
<p>The short answer is no, not in the traditional sense. Since Ozzie is a free WordPress theme, there is no support like you would normally get with premium themes in marketplaces like ThemeForest or WooThemes.</p>
<br />
<p>If there are bugs in the theme, please let me know by submitting an issue here, and Iâ€™ll look into fixing them.
