Ozzie is a free WordPress theme built using the Roots WordPress starter theme, and designed for users that like to showcase their featured images.
<br />
All future development will be maintained here, in GitHub.
<h2>Demo</h2>
The current demo for this theme can be found here: <a href="http://ozzie.tristandenyer.com/" title="Demo: Ozzie WordPress theme" target="_blank">http://ozzie.tristandenyer.com/</a>
<h2>Is there support</h2>
The short answer is no, not in the traditional sense. Since Ozzie is a free WordPress theme, there is no support like you would normally get with premium themes in marketplaces like ThemeForest or WooThemes.
