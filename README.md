# Ozzie: a free, responsive WordPress theme
Ozzie is a free WordPress theme built using the Roots WordPress starter theme, and designed for users that like to showcase their featured images.

All future development will be maintained here, in GitHub.

## Demo
The current demo for this theme is no longer available.

## Is there support?
Since Ozzie is a free WordPress theme AND outdated, there is no support at all. :(

Though, feel free to fork it and submit PRs to help bring it back to life!
